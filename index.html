    <h1>Jabin's Tech will be back soon.</h1>
    <p>Funny story, I accidentially uploaded a bunch of files called stuff like index.html, style.css, and readme.md into the main branch of my website's Github repository. Those files replaced the main files (index.html was supposed to be the homepage) and now this is what I'm left with. Don't worry, all of my articles are still intact, I just have to grab a backup of my website and re-upload the index.html, style.css and readme.md files. Again, my articles are still up, but the CSS file is missing so they will look very wonky. I apologize for this inconvenience, and the website should be back to normal soon.</p>
